  <h2>Photosensitive Epilepsy</h2>
  <p>
    A very small percentage of people may experience a seizure when exposed to certain visual images, including flashing lights or patterns that may appear in visual contents (such as this repository/site).<br>
    Even people who have no history of seizures or epilepsy may have an undiagnosed condition that can cause these “photosensitive epileptic seizures” while watching visual contents.<br>
    These seizures may have a variety of symptoms, including but not limited to: 
    <ul>
      <li>Lightheadedness</li>
      <li>Altered vision</li>
      <li>Eye or face twitching</li>
      <li>Jerking or shaking of arms or legs</li>
      <li>Disorientation</li>
      <li>Confusion</li>
      <li>Momentary loss of awareness</li>
    </ul>
    Seizures may also cause loss of consciousness or convulsions that can lead to injury from falling down or striking nearby objects.<br>
    <b>Immediately stop using this repository/site and consult a doctor if you experience any of these symptoms.</b>
    Parents should watch for or ask their children about the above symptoms. 
    Children and teenagers are more likely than adults to experience these seizures.<br>
    The risk of photosensitive epileptic seizures may be reduced by taking the following precautions:
    <ul>
     <li>Play in a well-lit room</li>
     <li>Do not play if you are drowsy or fatigued</li>
    </ul>
    If you or any of your relatives have a history of seizures or epilepsy, consult a doctor before continuing.
